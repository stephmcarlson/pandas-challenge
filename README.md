Importing student grade data and school budget and size
Outputs a recap table of all schools showing the below:
    Number of Schools
    Total Students
    Total Budget
    Average Math and Reading Scores
    % Passing Math and Reading
    % Passing Overall

Outputs another recap by school showing the below:
    Total Students
    Total Budget
    Per Student Budget
    Average Math and Reading Scores
    % Passing Math and Reading
    % Passing Overall

We also provide school data sorted by best and worst % Passing Overall

In addition we further break down the data aggregating:
    Math and reading scores by grade (9th-12th) and school
    Math and reading scores along with subject and total % Passing rates broken down by groups based on the Per Student Budget
    Math and reading scores along with subject and total % Passing rates broken down by groups based on the School Size
    Math and reading scores along with subject and total % Passing rates broken down by groups based on the School Type

A written analysis is also included with an overarching conclusion that the type of school, District vs. Charter, is a driving force for student test score passing rates. District schools have a much lower % of students passing Math, which is leading to a lower Overall Passing rate for those schools.
